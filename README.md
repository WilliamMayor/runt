# runt

Run a function on triggers. The little brother to Hazel for OS X.

## What?

Runt is a Python3 module that hooks into the OS X File System Events API (and others) in order to run a Python module when a trigger occurs. It came about because I use Hazel for some awesome "if this, then that" actions but found it a bit too restrictive when it came to being selective and dealing with hidden items.
